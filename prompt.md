Why does this line not apply? (script.js 890) I tried to console.log the fullContent and its correct and setting the .textContent from the getElement in the JS debugger console also works so I dont understand? does the elemtn get recreated somehow right after the call to displayChunkedTextContent or why? I even tried to log the element right after setting the property and the property was empty
